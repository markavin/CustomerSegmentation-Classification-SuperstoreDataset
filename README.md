# ðŸ§  Superstore Sales Analysis â€“ Customer Segmentation & Classification

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow involving both unsupervised and supervised learning.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
We use the [Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) to:
- Segment customers via **KMeans clustering**
- Assign cluster labels to the original dataset
- Build classification models to predict customer groupings

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Understand customer segments based on purchasing behavior
- Build a predictive model to classify new customers into segments
- Achieve high model performance with real business implications

## Highlights
- 9,900+ rows, 5+ mixed features used
- Feature selection applied before clustering
- Silhouette score: **â‰¥ 0.70**
- Classification models used: **Random Forest**, **KNN**
- Accuracy & F1-score: **â‰¥ 99.85%** on testing set
- Code well-documented with clear markdown explanations

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
